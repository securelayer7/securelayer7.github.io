      <description>Introduction In IoT/Hardware security it is common practice of dumping firmware/bootloader data inorder to perform reverse engineering for closed source system applications.
Well known easiest way is to download .bin/.zip (packed firmware) files from device manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s website which they provide to end users for firmware upgrade operations. And later us hackers/security researchers throw these files to reverse engineering softwares such as binwalk to check it&amp;rsquo;s contents and extract the needed stuff.</description>
