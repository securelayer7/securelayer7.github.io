      <description>As someone who likes to tinker with hardware, we often find ourselves opening up a device to find UART pins which are originally meant for debugging and testing We often use these to connect to the device. But most of us hit a small snag here.
Snag No 1: More often than not the pins are not labeled.
(So you mean they put those pins there so we can test the device but didn’t tell what pin was what because they didn’t want us to test it?</description>
